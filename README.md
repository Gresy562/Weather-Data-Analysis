## What I Learned
Working on this project has been a valuable experience that strengthened my skills in:

### Data Handling with Pandas
- **Reading Data**: Importing CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and ensuring data quality.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Filtering, grouping, and merging DataFrames effectively.  

### Statistical Analysis
- **Summary Statistics**: Computing mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data variability.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying and interpreting weather trends over time.  

### Problem-Solving and Debugging
- **Error Handling**: Debugging code and handling errors to improve robustness.  
- **Logical Thinking**: Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps.  

This project improved my **data analysis skills**, deepened my understanding of **Python and Pandas**, and gave me practical experience in working with real-world datasets.

# ✅ Conclusion

From this analysis:
- 🌡️ The most frequent weather was **Mainly Clear** followed by **Mostly Cloudy**.  
- 🌡️ Temperatures mostly ranged between -15°C and 25°C.  
- 🌫️ Visibility dropped significantly during Fog conditions.  
- 📊 Strong correlation observed between **Temperature** and **Dew Point Temperature**.  

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **real-world datasets** using Pandas & Numpy.  
- Perform **data exploration** with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()`.  
- Create **professional visualizations** using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
